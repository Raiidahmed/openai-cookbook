This talk will (a) lay out the climate science that drives our urgency to act and (b) describe how we use nonviolent direct action to demand change from government, corporations, and media.We  welcome you if you want to just learn about the state of the earth’s climate. We will love you if you join Extinction Rebellion to fight for it. We need everyone, whether or not you are in a position to perform direct action yourself.Come to hear more about what humanity is facing in the next decade, what has to happen to prevent catastrophe, and to connect with others who are wrestling with these truths. You are not alone.Refreshments will be provided!Please register ahead for this event as capacity is limited. ---Covid -19 event policy: Please bring your mask (preferably a KN-95 or N-95).

Natural hazards and extreme weather not only cause evacuations or displacement of Indigenous Peoples from traditional territories but also impact arable lands, where reduced productivity poses a threat to food security. These issues add to ongoing challenges such as food insecurity and human health. They also disrupt traditional ways of life, cultural cohesion, and the transmission of traditional knowledge and skills, particularly among younger indigenous generations. Indigenous wisdom is key to preserving planetary health, territorial health, and Indigenous identity. The need to respect and protect Indigenous rights requires our urgent attention, and joint efforts are essential in tackling these challenges through an inclusive approach. This seminar will  be moderated by  Lea MacKenzie, recognized with a 2021 Inclusion Vanguard Award as part of WXN Canada’s Most Powerful Women: Top 100. H.E. Ambassador Ilana Seid, Permanent Representative of Palau to the United Nations, will deliver special remarks. and a keynote speech will be made by Yapasuyongu．Poiconu, Director-General of the Council of Indigenous Peoples (Taiwan).

Taking place Monday, July 18 – Wednesday, July 20, this year’s conference “Maintaining Purpose” will take a wide-ranging look at the industry employing jewelry as a lens, while addressing what constitutes luxury in an age of responsible practice. In addition to considering the centrality of jewelry to culture and as historical document, we will discuss precious substances and their use, a broadened definition of natural resources to include cultural traditions and skills, new technologies, comparative approaches to extraction (for example, artisanal vs. larger-scale mining), the notion of premiums and what constitutes (and how to achieve) ethical sourcing and responsible practice—ranging from societal to environmental—and strategies for succession. The conference is highlighted by the participation of Silvia Furmanovich, Satta Maturi, and Pippa Small.Government, civil society, communities, and industry must preserve the magic, the romance, and emotional power of gold, diamonds, and jewelry for the consumer (while finding new ways to convey all of this) and, at the same time, do the hard work required to meet the imperatives of responsible sourcing and practice and environmental and social awareness, all of which underpin the UN's SDGs and the outcomes of COP 26.

But perhaps even more crucial is the need for the next generation of technological innovation to solidify its long-term strategic partnership with a stakeholder that has in recent history, been largely ignored: nature. We’ll need  to spearhead cooperative efforts that minimize harmful impacts on the environment, and to develop new innovations that leverage nature’s time-tested strategies for how we actually build technologies and products. Estimates suggest that biologically-inspired innovation will grow to $425B by 2030.* By integrating nature’s 3.8 billion years of R&D into our portfolio, and investing in systems, processes, materials, and products that truly embed fundamental principles of efficiency, adaptivity, optimization, resiliency and regeneration, we can rethink how we design and build our future and catalyze new models to transform the way we live.You’ll discover the power of nature’s genius and how principles found in nature can be used to solve the most pressing challenges of our time. Learn how to think, design, and innovate like nature does, and unearth 3.8 billion years of Earth’s evolutionary intelligence. T﻿here will be a nature walk to discover natural models in Greenwood Cemetery, during session 1 , but we will be meeting at Genspace. In this workshop, you’ll learn:what biomimicry is all about and how it relates to various industries.the biomimicry design process.how to approach problems through the lens of natural principles.how to start doing biomimicry research and  learn about the resources you can use.how to brainstorm, draw, and evaluate biological strategies and design ideas aimed at solving climate-related challenges.*Bioinspiration: An Economic Progress Report COVID-19 Safety Notice: Participants age 5+ must show proof of full vaccination (we recommend using the Excelsior Pass).

Southwest Madagascar is an excellent context in which to study human adaptation to climate change, since the region has long experienced a hypervariable climate and shifting resource distributions. The paleoclimate record of this region indicates that climatic conditions have shifted dramatically over the course of the Holocene, and that human and other biotic communities have experienced multiple extreme droughts over the past two millennia. Archaeological evidence from surface surveys and excavations suggest that short-term occupations of sites and frequent residential mobility have been a central feature of life on the southwest coast for millennia. Today, despite conservation and development initiatives that favor sedentarization of local communities, mobility remains key to the lives of fishing, foraging, herding and farming communities of the region. Our theoretical model highlights the central role of social memory in facilitating community mobility, social networking and shared resource use among groups of foragers, farmers, herders and fishers in the region. Using Niche Construction Theory, she argues that social memory, its maintenance and perpetuation contribute to a niche that makes human lifeways possible under the hypervariable conditions of southwest Madagascar. This work demonstrates the importance of preserving and engaging local, Indigenous and descendant (LID) knowledge to promote sustainability and develop robust and inclusive evolutionary theories of human adaptation to climate change.Event SpeakerKristina Douglass, Associate Professor of Climate at Columbia UniversityEvent InformationFree and open to Columbia University ID holders; registration required.  Part of the History and Climate Change workshop series hosted by the Environmental Sciences and Humanities Research Cluster at the Center for Science and Society and co-funded by the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy.

The date was chosen to appeal to college students because it fell between spring break and final exams.The birth of Earth Day led to the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).According to the EPA, today’s average American generates about 4.5 pounds of trash per day, compared to 2.68 pounds in 1960!Global average temperature has increased about 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016 (psst - Even changes of one or two degrees can cause potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather!)Find out more information and interesting facts here: Earth Day Fact SheetsWhat Can We Do?We must all do our part in protecting our planet and make choices towards a sustainable future!

She is driven by a desire to understand the world around her and to use her skills to make it a better place. Maddie has previously interned at the Manhattan Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in the histology department which sparked her interest in the medical field. After obtaining a clinical laboratory technology license in NYS, she worked at the Pandemic Response Lab (PRL) established by former NY Mayor Bill DeBlasio during the height of the COVID pandemic to help provide affordable and quick turnaround time PCR tests for all New Yorkers. After exposure to Python while working at PRL, Maddie decided to pursue a Master’s degree that beautifully wedded her clinical background and new found passion of data science and analytics. She acquired an internship at Healthfirst - a New York based insurance company where she leveraged large clinical data to develop a machine learning model aimed to predict members living with diabetes who will experience difficulty accessing health care.

We need to preserve the beauty of the earth and its natural resources for future generations. My inspiration is to encourage people to recycle waste to protect oceans and forests. Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans. If no action is taken, plastic will increasingly impact our ecosystems, health, and economies. The idea of the painting is to capture the nature’s beauty: pure ocean, shiny hills, gorgeous sky….its endless beauty and bring awareness to the issues of maintaining clean air & water.Featured Artist: Natallia Vasian — up and coming artist who will be auctioning off Abstract landscape “The Purity of Life” (20”x24”) for the cause! Natallia graduated from School of Visual Arts and now creates mixed media abstract textured art paintings that speak to our souls. In the modern world full of disturbing events, anxiety and mental health issues, Natallia wanted to create the world of happiness and peace, this is when she discovered art - it helps to achieve emotional state in our minds, get distracted from reality, and find inner peace through art therapy.PRIMARY  — our generous venue sponsor for this event; provides coworking and shared office space featuring an array of amenities designed to help people feel good while working to make their businesses thrive!Sera Wines — for their generous supply of Ferraton Père et Fils, allowing us to taste the history and passion behind Ferraton’s wines through a selection of white, red, and rosé.Founded in 2016, Sera Wine Imports sources high quality wines from both renowned and emerging European winemakers and introduces them to the USA.

As the science of climate change evolves from questions about how much global climate change there will be to questions of what we are going to do to mitigate and adapt to this climate, the requirements for Earth System models (ESMs) are changing. Here, I will review how land models in ESMs are evolving to be applicable to an ever-growing range of questions related to food and water security, effectiveness of nature-based carbon dioxide removal methods, ecosystem vulnerability, and changes in extremes. I will focus on how parameter estimation, coupled with other model advances, can improve the utility of CLM and CESM for this broadening range of climate science objectives.Bio: David Lawrence is a Senior Scientist in NCAR’s Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory.

After a momentary pause in operations after 2020, the art world is back in full swing with a robust pace of art fairs, exhibitions, and travel. How can galleries, shippers, and insurers work together to advance commitments to climate action in the sector? Speakers: Laura Lupton (LHL Consulting & Barder), Jake Burgess (AXA XL), Ted MacLean (Crozier), Maureen Bray (ADAA)10:35-10:50: The Art Provenance Report: following a successful inaugural Art Provenance Symposium earlier this year, we present, The Report. An essential addition to the various yearly art market reports, the report addresses the state of due diligence and provenance research across the institutional and private sectors. During the Art Provenance Symposium, over 20 delegates offered their expert opinions on issues ranging from repatriation and restitution, new databases and research tools, case studies on a wide range of possible red flags and different approaches to provenance research, the current cultural heritage crisis in Ukraine, and the change in public perception throughout the decades.

Structures built with raw earth and no cement or synthetic stabilizers have the potential to minimize embodied energy and climate-change impacts. Earthen building processes—contemporary versions of ancient knowledge—are promising components of climate-friendly design that require further exploration and demonstration. Organized by Lola Ben-Alon of Columbia University GSAPP’s Natural Materials Lab with the support of 1014 and The Architectural League, this program gathers design practitioners, educators, policy advocates, and material scientists to explore the possibilities of earthen materials. The panel will discuss natural earth- and fiber-based building materials, their manual and digitally-driven fabrication, life cycles, and supply chains, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using earthen materials in construction, renovation, and mass/insulation. The discussion will take place in connection with the exhibition Making with Earth, produced by the Columbia University GSAPP Making with Earth class at the Natural Materials Lab. Lola Ben-Alon is an assistant professor at Columbia University GSAPP, where she directs the Natural Materials Lab and the Building Technology curriculum.

Can epistemologies and practices built out of violence ever be remade towards justice? Does technoscience have a role in remaking our worlds out of the long aftermath?  Professor M. Murphy takes up a more than pessimistic and less than optimistic posture towards developing tactics for engaging the politics of technoscience. With Indigenous feminisms and queer leanings, Murphy draws out place-based tactics from environmental justice on Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee territories to navigate towards an Indigenous feminist anti-colonial politics with and against technoscience for the F/ISTS Keynote and Silver Science Lecture, ""With and Against Technoscience in the Aftermath.""About F/ISTSThe inaugural Feminist/Intersectional Science and Technology Studies Conference (F/ISTS) homes in on the reciprocal relations between techno-scientific knowledge and practices, on the one hand, and gender, race, class, and other intersecting axes of power, on the other. The interplay among technical and social dimensions of science, technology, and medicine is central to addressing many of the most pressing problems of our times, such as climate justice and environmental racism, health disparities, digital surveillance, and the growing mistrust in “science” as a domain of authority.About M MurphyM Murphy is a Professor of History and Women and Gender Studies at the University of Toronto, where they hold a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Science & Technology Studies and Environmental Data Justice at the University of Toronto. Their research is concerned with feminist, decolonial, and queer approaches to environmental justice, reproduction, Indigenous science and technology studies, transecologies, and data studies.

They are the author of The Economization of Life (2017), Seizing the Means of Reproduction (2012), and Sick Building Syndrome and the Politics of Uncertainty (2006), all with Duke University Press.

The interplay among technical and social dimensions of science, technology, and medicine is central to addressing many of the most pressing problems of our times, such as climate justice and environmental racism, health in/justice, and digital surveillance.P﻿ROGRAMThursday, April 27BCRW Silver Science Lecture & K﻿eynote: 6-7:30With and Against Technoscience in the Aftermath: Keynote by M. Murphy (University of Toronto)What relations can technoscience make with radical politics in the aftermaths of environmental violence, racial capitalism, heteronormativity, and settler colonialism? Can epistemologies and practices built out of violence ever be remade towards justice? Does technoscience have a role in remaking our worlds out of the long aftermath?  Professor M. Murphy takes up a more than pessimistic and less than optimistic posture towards developing tactics for engaging the politics of technoscience. With Indigenous feminisms and queer leanings, Murphy draws out place-based tactics from environmental justice on Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee territories to navigate towards an Indigenous feminist anti-colonial politics with and against technoscience for the F/ISTS Keynote and Silver Science Lecture, ""With and Against Technoscience in the Aftermath.""RSVP for keynote here Friday, April 28Session 1: 11:00am - 12:30pmExperience and Experiments: Banu Subramaniam (University of Massachusetts), Deboleena Roy (Emory University), and Kelsey Lewis (University of Buffalo), moderated by Nedah Nemati (Columbia University) How does the embodied — and socially embedded — life of a scientist inform practices of experimentation? Focussing on the fields of biology and neuroscience, this panel brings to the fore relationships between intersectional feminist theories and epistemologies, and scientific methods.L﻿unch: 12:30 p.m. (Box lunch included)S﻿ession 2: 2:00-4:00pmWaste, Race, and Colonial Detritus: M.

The corrective ML is trained to emulate a time-dependent global reference by learning state-dependent ‘nudging tendencies’ of temperature, moisture and winds.  The reference can be a reanalysis (for present-climate simulation) or a finer-grid version of the same model that may be more trustworthy across a range of climates. The ML is interpreted as a correction to the combined physics parameterizations of the coarse-grid model.  Unlike in other emulation approaches, heat and moisture conservation are built in. We train the ML on global 25 km reference simulations in multiple climates, and separately on a year-long 3 km simulation, and apply it in 200 km coarse-grid simulations.  The ML reduces annual-mean land temperature and precipitation pattern biases by up to 50% and enhances weather forecast skill.Bio: Chris Bretherton directs a climate modeling group at AI2 in Seattle which uses machine learning trained on global storm-resolving model output and observational data to improve climate model simulations.  He is an Emeritus Professor of the Atmospheric Science and Applied Mathematics Departments at the University of Washington, where for 35 years he studied cloud formation and turbulence and improved their simulation in atmospheric models.  He is an American Meteorological Society Charney Award winner,  IPCC author, AMS and AGU Fellow, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.Learn More: LEAP CHRIS BRETHERTON (Allen Institute for AI [AI2])","LEAP Center","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leap-center-45565168003"
